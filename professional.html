    <h1>Professional Work</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      I am a gameplay and UI programmer, though my skills and interests often lead me to reaching outside my core focus areas.
      My professional goal is shipping reliable systems, engaging gameplay features, and supporting cross-discipline teams.

          with gameplay systems, UI, and player progression. My main focus is on supporting short-term live events, where I build designer tooling and bridge the 
          gaps between Server, Client, and Backend systems.

          What a game to start my career with! Not just any remaster, the UI team built a 3d engine on top of the legacy game in C/C++,
          preserving the original game while making many new improvements like accessibility settings and gamepad support and allowing
          seamless switching between the 2d and 3d world.
