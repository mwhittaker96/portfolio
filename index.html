      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        My professional work focuses on shipping reliable code and engaging features for AAA titles, with focus areas in gameplay and UI.
        My personal projects explore simulation, software tools for everyday life, and sometimes hardware when I feel like getting hands on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I care about building fast prototypes, functional tools, and understanding how things work.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        My formal education is in civil & environmental engineering, though my practical education started much earlier; growing up, I spent hours in the
        robotics labs at CMU, where my dad worked as a robotics engineer and where I was lucky enough to work throughout my college years. Between my dad, my wonderfully creative artist mom, 
        and my own endless curiosity, I've always been someone who likes to tinker and build and explore. My career took an interesting turn in the final semester of my master's degree when I took a course in 
        numerical methods, which ignited a newfound love for programming, especially simulation. Ultimately this interest drove me into games and a career in programming. All of these elements inform my
        systems-oriented approach to games programming, driven by curiosity, fast prototyping, and a focus on long-term maintainability.
